# Java OOP Programs

This repository contains simple and clear Java programs demonstrating the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It is helpful for beginners who want to understand **classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction** with real code examples.

---

## 📘 Overview
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects and classes.  
This repository provides basic to intermediate examples in Java, written with clean code and comments for easy understanding.
